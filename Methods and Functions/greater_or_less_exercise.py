In this exercise, you need to define a function called is_greater(a, b) that checks whether a is greater than b.

Your task:
Define a function called is_greater(a, b) that:

Takes two integers a and b as input.

Checks whether a is greater than b.

Returns True if a > b.

Returns False if a â‰¤ b.

The value should be returned and not printed directly.
Inputs:
Two integers a and b read from the input.
Outputs:
A True value if a is greater than b.

A False value if a is less than or equal to b.

Sample Input 1:

10

5

Expected Output 1:

True

Sample Input 2:

3
7

Expected Output 2:

False
